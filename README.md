dotfiles
========

My linux dotfiles repository.

Installation
------------

These are configurations made by me, for me. They may not fit your needs or work at all.
But, if you want to use them anyway, you can run the [install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uKaigo/dotfiles/main/assets/install.sh) (SH) or just clone the repo and put the files in your `$HOME` folder.
